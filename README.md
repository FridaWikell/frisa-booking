## Introduction
The project is to build a website where you as a user can book a workshop to upcycle old things. If the user doesn't visit the website with the goal to book a workshop right away, the website should work as an inspiration.

## Table of Contents

## User Experience
### User Stories
- User Goals
- Site Owner Goals

## Design
The design is set to be modern but easy to read. It should draw the attention to the images which will enhance the chance to get the users to get inspired. The design should feel welcoming and like you're visiting a friends place. 

### Color Scheme
The color scheme is set to feel modern and harmonize with the hero image. Any bright colors in the scheme were avoided due to not draw any attention from the images at the website. The colors are reused on all pages to make every page feel familiar and to enhance the feeling that the website is an unity. 

### Typography
The typography were chosen to have a modern touch. They were chosen to feel easygoing and fun, but at the same time easy to read. The text was designed to incorporate some spacing, ensuring it doesn't appear as a dense block of text upon opening a page. The written communication across the website adopts a playful tone to foster a friendly atmosphere. Emojis was added to make the tone more playful and friendly.  

### Imagery
All the images are chosen to inspire the website users. The images should give a warm feeling with the help of the content and a warm tone in them. The images have been designed with a playful and dynamic excerpt to encourage user engagement and increase sign-ups for the workshop. The objects on the images are things that has been made by the leader of the workshops. In other words, they are objects that you can do at the workshops!

Description of the value this feature has for the users


## Features to be Added
Describe some additional features you could potentially add to the project that would increase user value - could be things linked to technologies not yet covered by the course but would be a benefit to the user for example, the ability to save an article, or add an article to the site, leave a review.


## Testing

### Validation of Code
Insert screenshots of HTML, CSS and any other code files being tested in the relevant code validator - CSS validator might not validate newer CSS syntax - be careful to read and fully understand why it is giving you an error.

### Lighthouse
You can perform a test of your website for performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO through the google chrome lighthouse test - it is in your Dev tools. Bear in mind that your internet connection speed plays a part in the performance figures obtained. Where it scores low, it will give you suggestions on how to improve the site - read the suggestions and think about how to implement them - it could be a good idea.
Do this for both Desktop and Mobile.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing
You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing

You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,
| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here |

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.

## Technologies Used

Detail what technologies you used. So what code languages, what frameworks, libraries, what software did you use to develop the site - Balsamic for your wireframes, Figma for a mockup?

## Deployment

Detail how to clone the repository, how to fork the repository - how to run the site locally and how to deploy it.


## Credits

You need to credit where you got anything for your site from.. where are the images from, are they all from the same site? where did you get the content from, if you wrote it yourself, did you fact check anywhere? did you get code from anywhere? if so, it needs to be clearly marked in both the code and the readme.
